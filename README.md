# .NET Image Downscaler  

A desktop application for image downscaling, built using C# and Windows Forms. This project showcases my skills in .NET development and GUI application design, focusing on simplifying the process of resizing images.

## About the Project  

The .NET Image Downscaler is a tool that allows users to reduce the dimensions of images by a specified percentage. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the application supports popular image formats and provides real-time progress updates during the downscaling process.  

This project was created as a personal endeavor to explore advanced .NET features and enhance my skills in developing Windows desktop applications. It serves as a demonstration of multithreading, cancellation tokens, and file I/O handling in a practical scenario.

## Features  

- **Open Image Files**: Select images in popular formats like JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.  
- **Flexible Scaling**: Downscale images by entering a custom percentage (1â€“100%).  
- **Real-Time Progress**: Monitor progress using an integrated progress bar.  
- **Thread Management**: Cancel operations at any time to prevent long waits.  
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or file issues.  
- **Batch Output**: Save resized images with informative filenames in the same directory as the original.
